# Python

1.argparse: A Python module in the standard library used to parse command-line arguments. It simplifies the process of building user-friendly command-line interfaces for Python programs by providing mechanisms to define arguments, parse them from strings, and automatically generate help messages.

2.directory: In computing, a directory, also known as a folder, is a file system cataloging structure used to organize files into hierarchical structures. Directories contain references to other files and directories, allowing users and software to navigate through the file system and access files stored within.

3.tuple: In Python, a tuple is an immutable sequence data type, similar to a list. However, unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after creation. They are defined using parentheses () and may contain a mix of different data types, separated by commas. Tuples are commonly used for grouping related data together, particularly when the data should not be changed.

4.os module: The os module is a standard library module in Python that provides a portable way to interact with the operating system. It offers functions for interacting with the file system, managing processes, working with environment variables, and more. Some common tasks performed using the os module include file manipulation, directory operations, and executing system commands.

5.subprocess: The subprocess module in Python provides a way to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. It allows Python programs to interact with external processes, such as running system commands, executing scripts, or launching other programs. The subprocess module is often used when more control over external processes is needed compared to using higher-level functions like os.system()
